# Script to capture/apply xinput calibration for the touchscreen
# The system will always run xinput_calibrator, which dumps
# output to stdout.
# * If that output indicates that the user interacted with the
#   program, it will capture the values to a file, to be
#   applied on the next power cycle.
# * If the unit is unattended, there is no interaction.
#   No new calibration will be stored,
#   and the old file will be applied.
